# Country Database

[DEMO ME ON GLITCH](https://fullstacc-country-database.glitch.me)

This web app demonstrates fundamentals of React and web apps in general, such as
- Handling state (vs. direct DOM manipulation)
- Hooks
- Requesting HTTP data (JSON in this case)

- It doesn't cover *Redux* , *React Native* , or other advanced concepts (yet)
These will be handled in subsequent projects.

- The page routing in this deployment of the app utilizes wouter as it's built into the Glitch boilerplate.
I could have used react-router, but I didn't

# Stuff I know could be improved
- If I deployed the app properly (i.e. via Heroku) I would have made the weather API call work (I removed the API key for the Glitch demo)
- Data fetching should be moved to its own module

# A note on transparency
- The inspiration for the code in this repo came from an assignment in the [University of Helsinki's fullstackopen 2021 course](https://fullstackopen.com/en/)
- The course is open ended and what you see here is done based on open-ended tasks that look like user stories (i.e. "the app allows you to filter by country")
- The code in this repo is not copypasta from a course
- If you're working through fullstackopen and you found this repo, test out my functionality but work through the problems yourself (you'll learn more)
